As of 12/1 Matt's refer me to wait for Carlos, but no update if release of liability is received. Given the Prev - week's Thanksgiving, I planned to follow-up the following week. 

As of 11/24 Matt's advised we can proceed with billing as normal. Will initiate contact this week, just need to check first with Carlos, if he received the release of liability so we are align with the approach. Slack. Next action will depend on Tims response, we will consult managers, and Matt if we are ok to push with hold action, due to the sensitivity of the escalation. 

As of 11/24 Matt: @Sun We can proceed with billing as normal today for Haven.  Let's wait for @Carlos C to confirm that he didn't receive the liability release over the weekend.  That won't change whether we should proceed with billing.  It would only change the amount.
@Carlos C Can you confirm that when it's less disgustingly early on the West Coast?
Matt: We've given them plenty of time.  Unless anyone disagrees, I think we can proceed with billing as normal.  That doesn't prevent further discussion.  It just makes clear that we cannot extend deadlines indefinitely.

As of  11/10: Matt: Haven followed up with Carlos late last week asking for us to provide some records to the nursing house surveyor's office in NM.  I should be able to send that this week (the surveyor reached out to Clipboard separately); the holdup currently is a discrepancy between in-app and in-metabase record.
Once I've submitted that, @Carlos C will let Tim know that we need the release back within 5 business days, or we need to lift all holds on billings.  I know that this has moved slowly at times, and I appreciate your patience.  My read is that we continue to better off with Haven not feeling a ton of urgency from us.  I don't want Haven to misinterpret urgency for fear.  I think they're more likely to sign if they don't think we're overly concerned.

As of 11/3: Matt: @Carlos C has/will send Tim our responses to their requests.  Some of them we could accommodate; others not.  Hopefully, we'll have an answer this week, but that's likely going to depend upon how quickly Haven responds.

As of 10/24  @Matt Orlins waiting for Carlos C meeting with Tim for liability release? Then we can decide on CN for compensation.  HOLD Pending action for now due to T&S incident, slack. irate cx.

SMALL AR. Matt Orlins, advised on Tuesday, 10/7, They've reviewed the letter.  @Mike Bryan responded last week, acknowledging receipt and sharing that we would get back to them after we had a chance to review it.  The letter itself asks for documentation by October 10, so we're still a few days ahead of that. Their contention that Clipboard is responsible for their losses is questionable for several reasons.  To the extent that we want to help them, we probably ought to frame it as providing good customer service rather than acknowledging (legal) responsibility here. @Carlos C is going to reach out to the facility.  Until he does, I would avoid offering the facility credit for any other shifts.  I'd probably stick to extensions.  That will give Carlos a little more to play with on the call in terms of potential resolutions.

As of 12/1 Matt's refer me to wait for Carlos, but no update if release of liability is received. Given the Prev - week's Thanksgiving, I planned to follow-up the following week. 

As of 11/24 Matt's advised we can proceed with billing as normal. Will initiate contact this week, just need to check first with Carlos, if he received the release of liability so we are align with the approach. Slack. Next action will depend on Tims response, we will consult managers, and Matt if we are ok to push with hold action, due to the sensitivity of the escalation. 

As of 11/24 Matt: @Sun We can proceed with billing as normal today for Haven.  Let's wait for @Carlos C to confirm that he didn't receive the liability release over the weekend.  That won't change whether we should proceed with billing.  It would only change the amount.
@Carlos C Can you confirm that when it's less disgustingly early on the West Coast?
Matt: We've given them plenty of time.  Unless anyone disagrees, I think we can proceed with billing as normal.  That doesn't prevent further discussion.  It just makes clear that we cannot extend deadlines indefinitely.

As of  11/10: Matt: Haven followed up with Carlos late last week asking for us to provide some records to the nursing house surveyor's office in NM.  I should be able to send that this week (the surveyor reached out to Clipboard separately); the holdup currently is a discrepancy between in-app and in-metabase record.
Once I've submitted that, @Carlos C will let Tim know that we need the release back within 5 business days, or we need to lift all holds on billings.  I know that this has moved slowly at times, and I appreciate your patience.  My read is that we continue to better off with Haven not feeling a ton of urgency from us.  I don't want Haven to misinterpret urgency for fear.  I think they're more likely to sign if they don't think we're overly concerned.

As of 11/3: Matt: @Carlos C has/will send Tim our responses to their requests.  Some of them we could accommodate; others not.  Hopefully, we'll have an answer this week, but that's likely going to depend upon how quickly Haven responds.

As of 10/24  @Matt Orlins waiting for Carlos C meeting with Tim for liability release? Then we can decide on CN for compensation.  HOLD Pending action for now due to T&S incident, slack. irate cx.

SMALL AR. Matt Orlins, advised on Tuesday, 10/7, They've reviewed the letter.  @Mike Bryan responded last week, acknowledging receipt and sharing that we would get back to them after we had a chance to review it.  The letter itself asks for documentation by October 10, so we're still a few days ahead of that. Their contention that Clipboard is responsible for their losses is questionable for several reasons.  To the extent that we want to help them, we probably ought to frame it as providing good customer service rather than acknowledging (legal) responsibility here. @Carlos C is going to reach out to the facility.  Until he does, I would avoid offering the facility credit for any other shifts.  I'd probably stick to extensions.  That will give Carlos a little more to play with on the call in terms of potential resolutions.

As of 12/1 Matt's refer me to wait for Carlos, but no update if release of liability is received. Given the Prev - week's Thanksgiving, I planned to follow-up the following week. 

As of 11/24 Matt's advised we can proceed with billing as normal. Will initiate contact this week, just need to check first with Carlos, if he received the release of liability so we are align with the approach. Slack. Next action will depend on Tims response, we will consult managers, and Matt if we are ok to push with hold action, due to the sensitivity of the escalation. 

As of 11/24 Matt: @Sun We can proceed with billing as normal today for Haven.  Let's wait for @Carlos C to confirm that he didn't receive the liability release over the weekend.  That won't change whether we should proceed with billing.  It would only change the amount.
@Carlos C Can you confirm that when it's less disgustingly early on the West Coast?
Matt: We've given them plenty of time.  Unless anyone disagrees, I think we can proceed with billing as normal.  That doesn't prevent further discussion.  It just makes clear that we cannot extend deadlines indefinitely.

As of  11/10: Matt: Haven followed up with Carlos late last week asking for us to provide some records to the nursing house surveyor's office in NM.  I should be able to send that this week (the surveyor reached out to Clipboard separately); the holdup currently is a discrepancy between in-app and in-metabase record.
Once I've submitted that, @Carlos C will let Tim know that we need the release back within 5 business days, or we need to lift all holds on billings.  I know that this has moved slowly at times, and I appreciate your patience.  My read is that we continue to better off with Haven not feeling a ton of urgency from us.  I don't want Haven to misinterpret urgency for fear.  I think they're more likely to sign if they don't think we're overly concerned.

As of 11/3: Matt: @Carlos C has/will send Tim our responses to their requests.  Some of them we could accommodate; others not.  Hopefully, we'll have an answer this week, but that's likely going to depend upon how quickly Haven responds.

As of 10/24  @Matt Orlins waiting for Carlos C meeting with Tim for liability release? Then we can decide on CN for compensation.  HOLD Pending action for now due to T&S incident, slack. irate cx.

SMALL AR. Matt Orlins, advised on Tuesday, 10/7, They've reviewed the letter.  @Mike Bryan responded last week, acknowledging receipt and sharing that we would get back to them after we had a chance to review it.  The letter itself asks for documentation by October 10, so we're still a few days ahead of that. Their contention that Clipboard is responsible for their losses is questionable for several reasons.  To the extent that we want to help them, we probably ought to frame it as providing good customer service rather than acknowledging (legal) responsibility here. @Carlos C is going to reach out to the facility.  Until he does, I would avoid offering the facility credit for any other shifts.  I'd probably stick to extensions.  That will give Carlos a little more to play with on the call in terms of potential resolutions.
